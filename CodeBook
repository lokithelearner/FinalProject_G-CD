Assign each data to variables

features <- features.txt 

activities <- activity_labels.txt 

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 

x_test <- test/X_test.txt 

y_test <- test/y_test.txt 

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt

x_train <- test/X_train.txt

y_train <- test/y_train.txt 

X  is created by merging x_train and x_test 
Y  is created by merging y_train and y_test 
Subject is created by merging subject_train and subject_test 
Merged_Data  is created by merging Subject, Y and X 


TidyData  is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement


Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

FinalData is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.

Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
